Function 

Recursion
  -A define function can call itself. It is a common mathematical and programming concept.
  -Every recursive function requires to have a parameter and a base condition

  Formula:

  def function(parameter):
    if (condition):    # base condition
      return something 
    else:
      return something + function(parameter2)


Where can we apply?
  - Things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative(loops-it keeps going) approach. 
  -Recursion works well for searching through types of sturcture (data sturcture) because it can serach multiple branching paths without having many checks/conditions.
